ABSTRACT:
> The who, what, when, and how of the Arpanet is usually told in heroic terms—Licklider's vision, the fervor of his disciples, the dedication of computer scientists and engineers, the work of graduate students, and so forth. Told by one of the key actors in this salient part of US and Internet history, this article addresses why the Arpanet was built.

Summary:
Author Stephgen Lukasik covers the timeline, and reasons behind the creation of ARPANET/DARPANET in his article "Why the Arpanet Was Built". The artcile delves into details of ARPANET's conception, and Cold War Origins, as well as the technological advances that made ARPANET possible.

Key Take Aways:
To me, this article represents how new technology is often the result of multiple discoveries all coming together. In the case of ARPANET case, it was the combination of computing, need for a decentralized communication network, and discovery of packet switching to best utilize decentralized networks.

Why It Was Chosen:
The ARPANET was a fairly important step in the creation of the modern day internet, so I felt an article on it would be incredibly relevant to cover.
