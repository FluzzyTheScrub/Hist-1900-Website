Summary:
The article Origins of the Binary Code is a brief summary of how modern binary code came to be, starting with the earliest known instances of the code, some of the arithmetic behind the code, to some of the uses for binary code leading up to modern computing.

Key Take Aways:
This articile brings forwards a fairly intersting perspective on coding; That while computer coding is fairly new, the discoveries that led to its creations are fairly old. Coding's origin from non-computation means also seems to appear often as well.

Why it was chosen:
As a staple of computation in general, binary code and its origins were an important topic to discuss.
