Summary:
This article displays the massive shift in the internet as times changed, and world altering events forever changed the landscape of the web. It begins describing the early asthetics and websites of the 90's, and discusses the gradual shift to modern day websites as old tech giants died, and new ones took their place. The article concludes with demonstrating the recent re-emergence of the "old web", as the asthetics of the 90s begin to return to popularity, and the big tech of the 2000s starts to degrade.

Why It Was Chosen:
This article has a unique persepective on the cultural impact of the internet, and how in turn, culture impacted the internet, while also acting as a fairly conclusive note on the course as a whole.
