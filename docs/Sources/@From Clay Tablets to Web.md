ABSTRACT:
>The paper discusses the evolution and development of library catalogues from clay tablets to the web-based catalogue. In the early stages, cataloguing was a local and individual library practice. Each library constructed its own catalogue, most suited to its purpose. A series of continuous changes through the ages, in both, conventional and non-conventional catalogues, including recent technology inputs added various features to the present day catalogue. Today the computerised catalogue may function like a portal and this function can be exploited infinitely to connect to a variety of data considered useful for library users. The system designers are trying to adopt new trends in OPACs. Web-based catalogues initiated Web 2.0 trends like RSS feeds, blogs, downloadable e-media, and instant messages. The facelift of the simple catalogue was eminent to keep up with the versatile needs of the widely web-exposed library users.

Summary:
In this article, author Shiv Kumar goes over a brief history of the evolution of indexing systems starting from the earliest forms such as clay tablets, to the modern computer-based systems still used today. Kumar also briefly discusses how even the computational indexing systems underwent a great deal of change just within the last 30-50 years, and explaining how modern indexing systems function.

Key take aways:
This article demonstrates how methods of indexing evolved as more volumes of recorded texts were required to be stored. A simple clay tablet was the only thing necessary to store what was likely a select few items, while modern liberaries have vast arrays of information, that require meticulous algorithms to index and search.
