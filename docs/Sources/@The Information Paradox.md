Summary:
The article by P.J Denning and T. Bell goes on to explain the general of mathematician Claude Shannon's Information Theory, or, treating information like math, and applying a set of rules and behaviors to it. Denning details the various way Claude rationalized "equations" for information, explaining them in thorough detail.

Key Take Aways:
This article provides a new way of looking at what storing, spreading, and understanding information. No longer is information mere reading/ being told of a topic, but rather a much more fluid system of informational transfer through various means. 

Why It Was Chosen:
I chose this article due to the unique way it frames understanding information. I am especially drawn to the way information transfer was represented mathematically, since this line of thinking eventually mutated into coding.
