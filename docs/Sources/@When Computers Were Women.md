Summary:
*When Computers Were Women* by author J.S Light delves into the lesser discussed history of the role of women in the history of computer science. Light explains that now believed male-dominated field of computer science originally was predominantly female run, and that as history progressed, the contributions of female workers to early computer science were primarily neglected. In particular, Light discusses the female role in the invention of the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), mainly the 6 female computers that programmed it.

Key Take Aways:
This article highlights an issue not only in the history of technology, but history in general: the removal of the female element in history. The article details not only instances of such occurrences, but also some potential reasons why women were "forgotten" constantly.

Why It Was Chosen:
As a man, I find it interesting at how often women are removed from the history books and under appriciated. Throughout the course, the names of countless women appear attached to many famous historical events/inventions that I had no knowledge of, so I felt this article was a good representation of this.

It seems I share the sentiment that women in history are often cover up with a classmate Sophie, as in their [personal memex on the same article](https://probablyanxious.github.io/hist1900-memex/Thoughts/Ignored%20in%20History/), they too discuss the issue.
