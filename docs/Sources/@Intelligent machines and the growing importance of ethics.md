ABSTRACT:
> Machines do not have morality so they must be designed according to shared ethical rules. In this regard, affective computing, a branch of information technology that aims to transmit information on human feelings to machines, can improve the relationship between man and computer, the HCI (human computer interaction), because a system capable of perceiving the user’s state of mind can better evaluate his intentions and his/her real will. In relation to the violation of human rights, it is necessary to develop ethical principles that can be negotiated on a computational basis and used in the face of unforeseen situations, to

Summary:
This article discusses the difficulty that has historically been encountered with human ethics while constructing artificial intelligence. While most AI is built with good intention, often times it will unintentionally cause ethical issues, which we must become more aware of as our culture becomes progressively ai centred. 

Key Take Aways:
The key take away from this article is that balancing a true neutral ai is incredbily difficult, given the fact that often times we are influenced by unconscious biases and tendencies. We only notice these issues when they become glaringly obvious in the form of ai.

Why It Was Chosen:
AI is one of the main focuses of modern day technology research, and seeing how closely the development of ai is linked to the internet, and the constant ethical conundrums surrounding ai today, I felt this article linked heavily to the course material.
