·   **Things we really liked:** Great improvement on your second memex! Glad you found my comments useful. Your interlinkages were stronger this time, and you had many more notes, which was good to see. Your continued engagement with the previous and new sources was particularly solid, specifically how you made connections between them and pulled out interweaving themes, ideas, etc. I also appreciated that you explained why you chose each source and why it was applicable. Engagement with visual culture was also awesome!

·   **Things to work on next**: Linking out to external sources and engaging with classmates’ ideas is suggested. This could be responding to their annotations on the class readings or working/speaking to them in class or on the discourse and making note of it in your memex.
