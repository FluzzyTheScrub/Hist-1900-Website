Summary:
Chapter 1 of *Faxed: The Rise and Fall of the Fax Machine* details the humble origins of the fax machine, and its competition with the other major telecommunication methods. Although not initially as popular as the telephones or telegrams of the time, the fax machine found some niche uses in its early days.

Key Take Aways:
The telecommunication wars posed not only an obstacle for telephones/graphs, but all other forms of long distance communication as well. With a niche role, stiff competition, and lack of technological advancement, the fax machine was fairly underwelming initially. 

Why It Was Chosen:
I chose this article as I think it shows a fairly unique perspective of the telecommunication wars; that being a technology that had almost no chance against the major competitors.
