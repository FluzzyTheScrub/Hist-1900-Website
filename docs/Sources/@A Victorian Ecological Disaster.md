ABSTRACT:
>Until the invention of the electric telegraph, messages sent across the vast colonial empires of the nineteenth century took many months to arrive. By 1907, some 200,000 nautical miles of cable criss-crossed the ocean floors. Insulation of the cables from seawater relied on gutta-percha, a natural plastic related to rubber. Gutta-percha is all but forgotten today, but during the Victorian era it was a household word. Ironically, the high-tech Victorian telegraph industry was served by a primitive cottage industry. The gum was extracted by killing wild trees in the forests of Southeast Asia, and the scale of demand ensured that many millions of trees were destroyed. This industry brought about a Victorian ecological disaster that presaged the greater destruction of tropical rain forests occurring today.

Summary:
The article *A Victorian Ecological Disaster: Imperialism, the Telepgraph, and Gutta-Percha* covers the interlinked history between the three aforementioned topics, and how they together resulted in massive ecological and humanitarian disasters. Through the discovery of Gutta-Percha plant's conductive properties, it was quickly used on underwater telagraph wires by the British Empire, which allowed information to be sent incredibly quickly. As maintaining the Empire required countless wires to maintain the massive web of telegraph communication, overreliance on gutta-percha began to impact environment as the plant was over-harvested, which further impacted the workers in communities reliant on gutta-percha manufacturing, as they become over-worked, or run out of work as the plant disappeared.

Key Take Aways:
This article represents many major issues that come alongside the advancement of technology; Over-use of natural resources as demand increases, the role technology plays in conflict/warfare, and the effect technology has on the less fortunate communites. It additionally demonstrates that even the most important technologies are at risk of fading into obscurity, such as the gutta-percha plant.

Why it was chosen:
Since technology is often seen as beneficial, this article brings to light the many downsides of technology that is usually less remembered. This is even more relevent when recognizing many of the issues of the time, such as tech's impact on people and the environment are still eerily relevent to today.
