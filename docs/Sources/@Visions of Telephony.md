Summary:
Chapter two of *Visions of Telephony* describes the bloody coperate battles fought between the first telephone companies such as Bell, Western Union, and AT&T. The corperate giants each tried their hands at controlling markets; Attempting to sway major businesses such as post offices into trusting their particular brand, or appealing to the population to become "the people's phone", all in hopes of coming on top. The companies even attempted some more underhand tactics, such as buying up stocks of opposing companies, or drastically lowering prices to starve out the companies with less to spend.

Additonal information on the history of the Bell company can be found [here](https://www.bce.ca/about-bce/history/timeline).

Key Take Aways:
This article represents the rise of technology as a major business. Although technology businesses already existed to a degree, the early phone companies represented a shift in business tactics; the telephone required an interconnected network in order to maximize it's potential, resulting in the companies scrambling to spread as far as possible, to both maximize reach, and suffocate other companies. Such actions resulted in the telephone companies growing incredibly quickly, and monopolize the industry.

Why It Was Chosen:
The great telephone wars to me represents the birth of modern day technology business, the idea of selling a technology so important it can't be ignored, resulting in the company growing absurdly large, and being able to monopolize their are of interest. Since this article thoroughly covers the topic, I thought it was appropriate to include.
