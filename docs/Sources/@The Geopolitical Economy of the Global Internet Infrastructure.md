ABSTRACT:
>According to many observers, economic globalization and the liberalization of telecoms/internet policy have remade the world in the image of the United States. The dominant roles of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google have also led to charges of US internet imperialism. This article, however, argues that while these internet giants dominate some of the most popular internet services, the ownership and control of core elements of the internet infrastructure—submarine cables, internet exchange points, autonomous system numbers, datacenters, and so on—are tilting increasingly toward the EU and BRICS (i.e., Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) countries and the rest of the world, complicating views of hegemonic US control of the internet and what Susan Strange calls the knowledge structure.

Summary:
Author D Winseck in this article argues that although  the internet is primarily ruled by the tech giants we hear of daily, in reality, the owners of the internet's hardware and infrastructure that have the most impact on the internet, as the infrastructure is the backbone of the internet.

Key Take Aways:
The main take away I found from this article was that although we think of the internet as a fairly neutral space, often times many factors that influence it subtly, meaning even something as minor as the ownership of underwater internet cables can result in the difference between a working, and unfunctioning internet.

Why It Was Chosen:
I found it very interesting to consider the fact that the internet is often influenced by many factors beyond those visible on the surface, so this article was an excellent source of demonstrating this.
