The process of something becoming increasingly worse as time progresses.

Within class, we were given this framework.

1. Something is establsihed, bringing in lots of new users. The "best form".
2. The original users are gradually pushed around to make space for business customers. This can be something like flooding the page with ads, or making a paywall, or offerring special business deals for partnering. Essentially, the original free users have been shoved out to make room for business (much like the [[Businessification of The Internet]]). Any original customer leftover at this point is here for the long haul.
3. Both the business customers and normal customers are shoved around. This could include incresingly strict advertising requirements, to the point the even advertisers begin to loose more than they invested.
4. The product slowly decays, all possible funds are slowly siphoned until it dies entirely. Fin.

Though I have labelled a few notes with enshitification, this can be applied to almost every note in some way.
