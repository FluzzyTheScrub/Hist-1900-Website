The article [[@Wire Pirates]] sits in a fairly interesting position on the topic of cybersecurity. Since the article was written in 1994, a time that the internet was only then starting to become more relevant,  it offers an interesting perspective on the changing times in the virtual world of the internet.

At the time, the internet was a completely chaotic place where anything, and everything was posted unregulated. This extended to the secruity aspect as well, as malicious software run rampant throughout the feebly protected web.

Author P Wallich comments on this lawless state of the internet, describing:

>Someday the Internet may become an information superhighway, but right now it is more like a 19th-century railroad that passes through the badlands of the Old West. As waves of new settlers flock to cyberspace in search of free information or commercial opportunity, they make easy marks for sharpers who play a keyboard as deftly as Billy the Kid ever drew a six-gun. Old hands on the electronic frontier lament both the rising crime rate and the waning of long-established norms of open collaboration.
