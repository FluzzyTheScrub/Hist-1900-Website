#Babbage #Faxed #ForgottenToTime 

In the [[@Faxed]], the early fax machine is described as overly ambitious. With its [[Ahead of its time|poor image quality]] and [[In the Shadow of The Phone|lack of infrastructure]] meant that the fax required technology that would not be created for the next few decades.
