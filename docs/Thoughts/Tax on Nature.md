In [[@Visions of Telephony]], author Robert MacDougall illistrates the utter monopoly state of communication technology, and its effect on the [[The Cost of Technology|average person]]. However, not nearly as discussed is the effect it had on nature, even this early on in history.

This is where [[@A Victorian Ecological Disaster]] comes in, as detailed in this article is the plight of the [[Gutta-Percha|gutta-percha tree]], which produced a conductive gum excellent for telegraph wires, which was so violently overharvested that it was at risk of[[Present Echoes Past| becoming completely extinct]]. This overharvesting was caused by the immense amount of [[A Fight With an Octopus|expansion]] telegraph companies pushed for, and it is almost of no doubt that one of the early telegraph monopolies, Western Union contributed to this issue.

This issue was not only present then, but now as well, as overharvesting by large corperations is commonplace nowadays.
