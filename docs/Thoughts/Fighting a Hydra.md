#WhyARPANETWasBuilt  #Thought 

A thought I had while reading [[@Why ARPANET Was Built]] was the similarity between [[Packet Switching|decentralized networks]], and the hydra of Greek myth.

In the myths, the hydra was a multi-headed snakelike creature with the capability to regrow any removed heads, only killed once every head was removed and the neck stumps burned. Distributed networks work in a similar way, the network is incredibly hard to destroy, as since no-one computer  has more control than another, taking down the network would require taking down each and every member of the network, much akin to killing a hydra. 

It is this hydra-like fortitude that made a distributed network an effective method for [[ARPANET]].
