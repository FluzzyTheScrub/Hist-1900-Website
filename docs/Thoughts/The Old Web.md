In the 90's, the web had an entirely different landscape than what we know now, as giants such as Google had just began to emerge. It ahd come far from its early [[ARPANET]] days and entered a fairly [[Changing Times|chaotic era]], with its own popular websites, and aesthetics reflecting this with equally bombastic websites.

Personal Web:
In the early 90's, the corperate web we know today was not nearly as developed, and the web was mostly full of personal websites. As a result, website content often greatly varied; one website could be entirely deticated to shoes, while another could be a professional book review , a complete grab-bag. As a result of the internet's claim as a "free space to express yourself", many personal websites had gaudy appearances, eye-burning colour schemes, and were flooded to the brim with images, all in the display of personal expression. A quote from artist Olia Lialina in [[@404 Page Not Found]] best describes the old web as:

>A web of sudden connections and personal links. Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connection and a more powerful computer. One could say it was the web of the indigenous . . . or the barbarians. In any case, it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com ambitions, professional authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts.

Webhosts:
Some popular web hosts of the time included Geocities, Angelfire, and Tripods, all sites under which users could post their personal websites. These sites offered a place for the less techy to have a space to upload their personal websites. Many of these websites no longer remain today.

Early Web Browsers:
Before the browsers of today, webistes needed to be reached via directly connecting to their ip, essentially setting the source for [[Packet Switching]]. As expected, this was a huge hurdle, and opened space for an easier way to find websites. In comes Gopher protocols, pages which were essentially massive catalogues of popular links to websites.

This protocol was even further expanded on when they were utilised by some of the first web browsers such as Netscape, which were essentially nicer-looking gopher protocols. However, like Geocities, some of the original browsers [[The Death of Netscape|have not survived to the modern day.]]

Looming Business:
Though these free times of the internet were thoroughly enjoyed, the business potential of the internet [[Businessification of The Internet|would soon drastically change the landscape.]]
