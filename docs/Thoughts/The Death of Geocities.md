In 1999, Yahoo! was empowered by the [[Businessification of The Internet]], and purchased Geocities, beginning a process of slow dismantling. Once a staple of [[The Old Web]], Geocities was a space for users to host their personal websites and share with others. Users noticed changes slowly occurred, as the once whimsical URLS such as "Magical Forest" for children's content was replaced with username-based. As users dropped from the site to move onto new ventures, the site primarily became a host for new internet users, leaving it a husk of its original form.

Following the [[The Dot Com Crash]], Yahoo was not nearly as popular as it once was, being cripped by the introduction of Google, meaning some cuts had to be made. In 2009 the Geocities website suddenly ceased without warning, taking countless websites with it. In a single instant, an entire portion of internet history was completely destroyed. This truly is a prime exaple of [[Enshitification]].
