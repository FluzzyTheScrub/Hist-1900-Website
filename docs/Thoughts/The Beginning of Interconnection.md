An interesting thought I had from from [[@Visions of Telephony]], what was the effect of companies building [[A Fight With an Octopus|massive connection networks]] on the general interconnectivity of the global community? It was already described in [[@A Victorian Ecological Disaster]] that Europe had massive telegraph network set up by the British Empire in order to better maintain its colonies, however would this unintentionally lead to the formation of a global country as more and more individual countrious gained access to the technology?

This tech would eventally go on to result in interconnected tech like the [[ARPANET]]
