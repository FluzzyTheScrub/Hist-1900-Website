A though I had on [[@404 Page Not Found]] was how with the introduction of new media has changed the genral selling of media overall. 

Starting with the television and radio, each channel had a specific amounts of time for content and advertisements, and as a result, everything was built around the concept that only so much time was availiable. Thus many shows would have incentives to return back to the media through cliffhanger ending, and engrossing storylines. Even advertisements had to work with this restrictions, resulting methods such as easily rememebred jingles, being produced.

Cut to modern day, most media is hosted on our phone, or on a computer, to which media has adjusted. Nowadays, limited time is no longer the limit, but rather the attention span of the user. Thusly, content has become shorter form, such as the rise of Tiktok and youtube, and media platforms have multiple notifications to attempt to return the user as frequently as possible.
