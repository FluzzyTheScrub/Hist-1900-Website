>In the early stages, cataloguing was a local and individual library practice, whereby each library constructed its own catalogue best suited to its purpose.

This passage struck me as interesting, as since libraries had no standard way to organize their data, it was essentially up to whoever ran the establishment to decide which pieces of literature were deemed valuable enough to be readily available upfront, and which literature was less valuable, and would require more effort to reach. This means the catalogues could be potentially biased towards the library owner's values, even if unintentionally.
