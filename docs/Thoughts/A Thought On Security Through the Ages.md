The concept of cyber security being a fairly new area of technology I find very interesting, as before  many important technologies were commonplace, there really was no need for such security. 

As described in [[@Wire Pirates]], [[The Earliest Hackers]] arose as the phone systems became more mechanized, and public, since this meant they had more exploitable features. Compare this to something like the ENIAC described in [[@When Computers Were Women]], which likely would not require much secuirty due to the sheer complexity of the machine compared to the general knowledge at the time, and even if broken into, the average person would likely not get much from the machine due to its mathematical calculations not being particularily usefull. Even a simpler technology like the telegraph would not require much security, as it not only requires knowledge of how to use the machine, but knowledge on what other telegraph machines were connected to the network.

Essentially, since most important tech was fairly niche, and required a specific skillset to operate, the complexity itself acted as a form of security, meaning no further security was required.
