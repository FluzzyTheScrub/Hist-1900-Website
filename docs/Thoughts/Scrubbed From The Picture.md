>Women seem to have vanished from the ENIAC story, both in text, and in the photographs. One photograph accompanying the New York Times story foregrounds a man in uniform plugging wires into a machine. While the caption describes "attendants preparing the machine to solve a hydrodynamical problem", the figures of two women in the background can only be seen by close scrutiny. Thus the press rendered a follow -up coverage rendered invisible both the skilled labour require to set up the demonstration, and the gender of the skilled workers who did it.

This quote represents how credit is often removed from those involved from actions as small as changing some wording, the framing of a photo, or even altering it. This is shown further in a later release of the image, which completely removed any reference to the women who worked on the machine, giving the implication that the dynamic had shifted from the position being a woman's to that of a man's.
