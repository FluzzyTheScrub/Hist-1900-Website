Much like many of its members from the [[The Old Web]], Netscape too faced a slow and painful demise.

In the old days of the internet, Netscape was the de-facto browser, the prime source of finding other websites. However as time progressed, the Microsoft company felt threatened by the presence of competing browsers, and thus began shady tactics akin to the days of [[Underhand Tactics|the telephone wars]]. 

Microsoft began backing Netscape's competitor Internet Explorer by packaging it with every Windows computer, and eventually progressing to the point where Netscape coulnd't be installed on Windows machines. As a result, more and more users began using Internet Explorer over netscape, as it became the difference between using the browser built onto your PC, and going to find Netscape; To new PC users, the choice was easy. 

As a result, Netscape usage plummeted, even after Microsoft was forced to some damages and change their tactics, it was far too little to late, and it perished in 2008.
