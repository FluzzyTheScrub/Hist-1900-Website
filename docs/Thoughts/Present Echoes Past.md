>Even the very largest (gutta-percha) trees yielded less than 3 pounds (1.36 kilograms).... although some authors claimed higher average yields than 11 ounces, the mean yield was very small, and the relentless pressure of the market for more gum meant a constant search for more trees to supply the demand.

This quote represents the impact that such a vital technology had on the environment. In overharvesting a resource that took too long to sustainably replenish, the population gutta-percha trees was at risk of being completely depleted.

This scenario represents a still ongoing modern issue, in which many of the technologies we rely on requiring unsustainable harvesting on scales potentially even larger than the extraction of gutta-percha.
