>One of ITâ€™s greatest accomplishments is transformation of the card catalogue to the OPAC to facilitate libraries. An OPAC is a library catalogue accessed via a computer terminal for the benefit of library users..... A catalogue database is the machine-readable form of the card catalogue and is made up of a number of bibliographic records which comprise a collection of data elements

This scenario somewhat reminded me of the concept of [Black Box Testing](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/black-box-testing/), as in applying these systems, the library users no longer need to have knowledge on how to traverse the card catalogue methods of searching, but now are able to merely input search terms, and recieve what they are looking for, with no need to know the internal workings of the machine.

Classmate Joseph Mcnarma additionally covered the topic in [their personal memex](https://jmcn99.github.io/hist1900-memex/atomic_notes/blackbox/).

This idea also seems to [[Contradiction|contradict a point made in ]] [[@We May Think]]
