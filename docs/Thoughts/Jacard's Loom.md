>JACQUARD LOOM weaves by means of punched cards that control the lifting of warp threads as weft threads pass through. Such looms, developed in France early in the 19th century by Joseph Marie Jacquard, were the first binary.controlled production machines.

Seeing the true size of Jacquard's loom after discussing it in class makes me realize that not only did machines get faster as time progressed, but also significantly smaller as well.

For the punch cards that programmed the loom, view [[Punch Cards]]

Such a concept is also covered in [[@We May Think]], discussed on the page [[A Whole Roomful of Girls Armed With Simple Key Board Punches|here]]
