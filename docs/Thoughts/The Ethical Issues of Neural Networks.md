With the increase in the use of neural network AI in our modern time, it is worth discussing some of the ethical issues attached to the use and training of such machines:

Creator Vs Ai:

A very hot topic in the world of ai ethics right now the the discussion of neural networks and copyright. Neural networks must be fed human created data in order to learn to create material like a human, however there is only so much original content the programmers can create to feed the ai, and eventually they must take to work from other people for more data. This is where the issue with copyright appears, as in a way, the ai is building new data by directly stealing from the author's creation, and without credit, since often times it steals from multiple authors per generated item. In the case of ai writing, this could be stealing direct paragraphs, snippets of text, or other content stolen without producing a source (which also has its [[Biases in Ai|own slew of problems]]). The more controvertial topic is ai art, as ai may end up stealing from multiple artists, copying sections of their works and claiming it as their own. Many ai hosts avoid this controversy by blaming the ai itself, since they technically had no hand in the copyright infringement directly. 

Privacy Vs Ai:

Especially in the case of public ai, there is a distinct possiblity that the privacy of users is at risk when interacting with these machines. Since popular ai chatbots like ChatGpt build themselves from user interaction, there is a distinct possibility that any private information shared with the machine will become forever ingrained within the network, and thus, no longer private to the user alone. This too extends to other neural networks, as sources fed to them may also contain private information, that again when added to the network, is forever part of it. This is even disregarding ai that gathers uses user data like cookies in order to perfectly generate ads, and learn more about the person's demographic for futer advertisement.

Truth Vs Ai:

An increasingly common issue with ai is that it people tend to blindly trust the "superintelligent machine" while in reality, a majority of what the machine creates is complete fabrication. Since most ai are stochastic parrots, [[The Chinese Room|what appears to be true intelligence is often a much simpler response to a series of key words]], which the attempts to mimmick how a human response would be structured. This means ai is prone to pulling from any source in it's database, even those from untrustworthy or radical sources, or even outright fabricating facts based on unrelated sections from elsewhere in the database, leading to many untrue and fake responses.
