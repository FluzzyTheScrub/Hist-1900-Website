>In 1893 , a year of telephone service cost between $ 60 and $ 150 in most cities and could cost as much as $ 200 in Chicago or New York. Ordinary Americans and Canadians would not be lining up for telephone service at these prices; the average worker earned just $ 450 per year in 1893. Even a doctor or lawyer making ten times that amount would have to think twice before installing a telephone in his home.

This aspect of tech business represents an issue still present today: vital tech is incredibly pricy. Since the most powerful telephone companies essentially controlled the entire technology, they could charge absurdly large prices, with little to no other companies to compete with. 

Today many of the most popular tech companies (think Apple and Google) can charge absurd rates, and set up unreasonable terms of service due to the fact that they are essentially the sole producer of their brand of tech. Although there are more laws in the way of such practices (primarily thanks to the acts of the telephone companies in the past), many companies still push their profits as much as possible.
