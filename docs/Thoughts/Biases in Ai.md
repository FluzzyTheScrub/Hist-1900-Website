An issue discussed within [[@Intelligent machines and the growing importance of ethics]] is the topic of biased ai. Although it may seem impossible that an ai is capable of bias, it is important to note that [[The Ethical Issues of Neural Networks|ai often is built upon human-created data]] , meaning that it would pick up any human biases as well.

Since machines are themselves based on algorithms, ai are also prone to [[Biased Sorting]].

In the article Humane Artificial Intelligence, author P. D Hershock demonstrates this exact occurence:

>Numerous studies ("Gender shades" by the researcher Joy Buolamwini from MIT included) sustain that facial recognition can jeopardize our freedoms. Indeed, research conducted on different facial recognition systems (such as IBM Watson, Microsoft Cognitive Services and Face++) has shown that some ethnicities are treated in a more imprecise way compared to others. Notably, identification accuracy for Caucasian men was 99%, but only 34% for women with dark complexion.

The ai was created unintentionally with a racial bias due to the uncoscious (or conscious) biases of the programmers who likely used primarily images of Caucasian men to train the ai.

In essence, this means any given ai can be prone to biases, even unintentionally, due to the fact that every ai is programmed with the biases of the programmers/data sets used to train the ai.
