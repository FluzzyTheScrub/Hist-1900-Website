Whithin [[@Visions of Telephony]] is an image labelled "The Octopus Releasing It's Grasp", which represents the sheer reach and power the Bell telephone had at the time. 

I feel this is a fairly apt representation, as not only was Bell labs large in size, but it also physically had networks of telephone cables spanning across North America, making them a threat for even companies far away from the Bell headquarters.

This also applies to many of the other early telecommunication companies, as they all tried to spread their networks as far as possible.
