In the early days of the [[ARPANET]], [[A Thought On Security Through the Ages|security was less of a concern]], however as computers become more numerous, and access to the internet easier, there was a much higher risk of bad actors taking advantage of the system. And attack they did. As described by P Willarch in [[@Wire Pirates]]:

>(In 1998) a rogue program unleashed by Robert T. Morris, Jr., a Cornell graduate student, brought most Internet traffic to a halt for several days

While the internet [[Changing Times|may have been something akin to the wild west in its early days]], even the west had Sheriffs.

In terms of online security, one of the earliest, and most ancient forms of keeping data safe was encryption, a basis of cyber security. Encryption involves essentially hiding the true data by translating it into a code language, with the code key being known only to specific machines. This process is [[Codes and Cyphers|incredibly similar to codes and cyphers of the past]], but with the calculatory power of computers, encrypted data can be encoded even further than most human codes ever could. Combined with [[Packet Switching]], each data segment may be encrypted dozens of time over, making messages particlarly difficult to crack.

This process is an amazing example of the use of information theory, which is described more thoroughly in [[@The Information Paradox]]
