https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutta-percha

>The key to success of the new (telepgraph) system was a natural plasic gutta-percha which proved indespensible as insulation for submarine cables.
>[[@A Victorian Ecological Disaster]] Pg 560

>Today gutta-percha is largely forgotten.... It is difficult to think of another once-ubiquitous industrial and domestic commodity that has been so comprehensively forgotten as this rainforest gum.
>[[@A Victorian Ecological Disaster]] Pg 564

This particular example demonstrates a few interesting points worth mentioning:

- The dissappearance of knowledge of gutta-percha as a material demonstrates that old technology, once considered useless when newer, more efficient technology appears, is often cast to the wayside, and forgotten. This applies not only to physical technology, like how the telegraph or [[Punch Cards]] are primarily depreciated today.

- This case of gutta-percha also also represents the shrinking awareness of technology stemming from natural sources. When thinking of technology today, most think of industrial factories, production lines, and thousands of small, man-mande mechanical compenents. In reality, the materials needed for such components came from, and will allways come from the natural world around us. Few think of the earth from which the gold in their phone came from, or where the raw materials used in displays came from. A historical example would be the [[Tax on Nature|overharvesting from telegraph companies]].
