As connected networks increased in complexity, it was recognized that some extra notice to security was required. Originally, a complex enough system was enough to ward off most looking to abuse the system, however, as knowledge of the systems became more publc, and free time became more commonplace, [[A Thought On Security Through the Ages|this type of security became less reliable]], to which author of [[@Wire Pirates]], P Willarch explains:

>The first, biggest error that designers seem to repeat is adoption of the “security through obscurity” strategy. Time and again, attempts to keep a system safe by keeping its vulnerabilities secret have failed.

Some of the earliest instances of cyber security issues began with the telephone in the 60's, with the war between AT&T, and phone "hackers" known as phone freaks, or "phreaks". During this time, some individuals realized they could manipulate phones to initiate free calls by whistling or using other devices to produce various tones into the reciever. These tones would mimmic the genuine mechanical tones used to operate the phone lines, meaning these phreaks had total control over the phone lines, costing AT&T thousands in lost revenue, [[Dawn of Cyber Security|Yet, this only marked the beginning of cyber security.]]
