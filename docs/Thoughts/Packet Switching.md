[[@Why ARPANET Was Built]]
The technology of packet switching has an interesting history, as it was technically discovered twice around the same time in the 1960's; Once in America by electrical engineer Paul Baran and another time in the UK by Computer Scientist Donald Davies.

Packet Switching is the process of transferring complex data across a decentralized network by breaking it into multiple pieces and re-assembling at the target location, a with a similarity to a [[Packing Info|previosuly discussed topic]].

A centralized network is one in which info can be shared to one another by first passing it to a "host" computer, then moving it from there to a target computer. This approach is vulnerable however, as if the host is taken out, the entire network perishes. With a distributed network, all machines have connections to a handful of other machines, but not every one at once, meaning even if one is taken down, multiple pathways still exist for information to travel to. The primary issue of this approach is that it is potentially prone to error, as going across multiple computers risks information becoming corrupted or improperly transported, however package switching mitigates this by breaking up the info, making a distributed network more feesable.

This robustness made taking down a distributed network almost like [[Fighting a Hydra]].

It was the capability for an information network that was able to sustain damage to links within its network that led to packet switching's use in [[ARPANET]].

A better example of centralized networks can be found in [[A Fight With an Octopus]].
