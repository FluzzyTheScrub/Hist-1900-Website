> Our present languages are not especially adapted to this sort of mechanization, it is true. It is strange that the inventors of universal languages have not seized upon the idea of producing one which better fitted the technique for transmitting and recording speech. Mechanization may yet force the issue, especially in the scientific field; whereupon scientific jargon would become still less intelligible to the layman.

[[@We May Think]]

This concept I find particularily interesting, as Bush seems to be implying that the creation of some sort of language specifically for transmitting data could help with the idea of storing information, which is in somewhat of a way, coding verbally. In a way, coding languages somewhat do this, turning brief commands into stored procedures to follow, both understood by the machine, and (at least to some degree) most people.

Even with one of the most simple forms of programming, Binary Code, simple ones and zeros are used to store data understandable to the machine, and to those who built the code.

Bush's concern about such a language becoming uninteligible to those outside of scientific circles  remains valid, as often a program will often require heavy commenting to explain its inner workings, even to those within coding fields. This could also be viewed as a form of [[A Thought On Security Through the Ages|security by obscurity]].

Though, Bush's idea also seems to hold some [[Contradiction]] when compared to other sources.
