As explained in [[@Why ARPANET Was Built]], the ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency), later DARPA was a protocol used to create a decentralized network of computers using [[Packet Switching]]. This protocol utilized packet switching to avoid sending continuous binary signals through the network, and instead break up codes into multiple simpler segments that were harder to corrupt. 

This technology was developed during the 1970s in response of the Cold War, as the decentralized nature of the network made it incredibly durable, meaning communication could be continued even in the event of multiple other computers being destroyed.
