>For most of human history, the speed of communication was largely restricted to the pace of physical transportation. This had social, political, and economic implications, for although imperial armies were able to conquer suprisingly vast areas of land relatively quickly, maintaining the unity of empires... was a constant battle: the barbarians lurked constantly, if not at the gates, then at the outskirts of the realm.... Put simply, the "tyranny of distance" was a constant threat to the integrity of empires.

The phrase "tyranny of distance" perfectly encapsulates the impact of altering the space-time discrepancy. Distance is often the enemy, when responding to emergency scanarios; The medical responders must reach the patient in time, the hungry must recieve food as soon as possible, the enemy army's push must be counteracted posthaste, etc. Upon shifting this dynamic, and shortening the time required to cross a space, the distance becomes less "tyrannic", as a quicker response allows for more actions to be taken in the time that would initially be wasted on travelling.

This advantage was [[The Cost of Technology|was not without cost however]].
