One interesting concept I thought connected well to [[@The Information Paradox]] was the thought experiment known as the [Chinese Room](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/).

What the experiment essentially entails is that although a computer may appear to give intelligent and thoughtful responses, in reality, it is merely following a thorough set of possible responses, and has no true intelligence of its own. 

This experiment highlights the fact that in information theory, even though we potentially know what information was inputted, and the result that was outputted, we have no way of testing how intelligently this process was done.

Additionally, this concept is similar to that of the Black Box mentioned in: [[The First Major Cataloguing Code]]
