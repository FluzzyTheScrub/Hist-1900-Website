One particular connection I noticed between [[@Visions of Telephony]] and [[@The Amherst Method]] were the potential underhanded tactics used by the parties mentioned in the articles. In the case of Telephony, the telephone companies tried all tactics under the sun to ensure they alone kept customers with their brand, while in the case of the Armherst Method, the supposed creator of the Dewy Decimal seemingly poorly referenced all of his sources, essentially leaving his name alone in relation to the system.

A similar connection is mentioned in [[Disappearing Act]].
