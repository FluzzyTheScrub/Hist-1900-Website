[[@Origins of the Binary Code]]

This image not only demonstrates one of the earliest forms of coding operations for a machine, [[Jacard's Loom]], but also partly relates to one of the main concepts of [[@How The Page Matters]]; That pages are more than just the stereotypical slips of paper we think of. In the case of these punch cards, the information of the instructions is litereally, and physically stored within the cards, each hole (and lack of a hole) being a physical guide for the machine to follow.

This concept is somewhat expanded on in [[Modern Day Punchcards]]
