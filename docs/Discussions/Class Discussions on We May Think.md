#WeMayThink #LinkOut

The article [[@We May Think]] was a popular topic among students, so I felt it beneficial to look over some student notations.

Karival's segmenting of the quote is somewhat cut off but in full is:
"The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability."

As Karival mentions, the true reprocussions of cheap tech is often ignored. Typically, such low prices can only come from places of exploitation, especially in the case of modern day luxuries like computers and phones, which often have deep roots of exploitation. For example, a large amount of cobalt for computing devices is the result of [exploiting workers](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/02/01/1152893248/red-cobalt-congo-drc-mining-siddharth-kara), and computing devices are often sourced from China due to low cost from underpaying employees.

This student brings up an excellent point, as oftentimes we think something is stored forever once it has been digitally stored, this is far from the case, as still this data must be stored SOMEWHERE in the physical world. This is minroly discussed in [[When the Virtual Interacts With the Real]]

This student again brings up an excellent point. This prediction of Vanaver somewhat came true, as a majority of test results we recieve are automatically porcessed by machines, which spit out the exact results we want.
