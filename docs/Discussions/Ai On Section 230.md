Within class, we were introduced to an ai-produced article on [[Section 230]], a law regarding the responsibility and immunities of website hosts.

>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) is an exception to certain provisions in the law, such as those prohibiting minors from accessing obscene material online or restricting access by adults to sexually explicit content. The CDA was passed into law on February 15th, 2006 and Section 230 became effective that same year. This provision of the Act has been highly controversial due in part to its vagueness; it is not clear what exactly constitutes “obscene” or “sexually explicit material.”
>
>The Supreme Court ruled on a case involving this section of the CDA, Ashcroft v. ACLU, that Section 230 was constitutional and did not violate First Amendment rights as it only restricted access to certain materials deemed obscene by Congress or state legislatures; it didn’t ban any particular type of speech outright.
>
>The CDA has been amended several times since its inception, most recently with the passage of The Protect Act (PROTECT) which further clarified what material is considered “obscene” and made sure that Section 230 was not being abused to access such materials by minors. This law also provided penalties for those who would try to circumvent these restrictions, making it clear that the government takes this provision of the CDA very seriously.
>
>Section 230 has been a highly contested part of the Communications Decency Act since its inception and remains so today as people continue to debate what material is considered “obscene” or if minors should have access to such materials at all, let alone via circumvention tools like virtual private networks.

Many fellow classmates had some interesting points on the matter on Hypothes.is

As Eric pointed out, this is indeed the case, in order to completely shield youth from harmful material, it would require extreme privacy invasion to completely confirm a person was of legal age. Such things would go against the few freedoms of the current internet.

This anonymous student brings up another good point, as what is deemed "offensive" may vary from person to person, especially in the view of governmental figures, of whom the most powerful tend to be older, with a stronger belief in older (and often less progressive) values. Such people may risk stagnating the progress of the internet entirely.

This notice from Jen points out a major issue with ai-written articles and claims: They have the potential to be completely fabricated, or from unreliable sources. Whereas human writes must carefully back up their claims and proofs, an ai is merely mimmicking a professionally written article, and has no incentive to properly source any of its claims, and thus, will pull from anything and everything that fits the general structure of the desired claim. This goes back to the concept of [[The Chinese Room]].

For my own notes on the article:
- I noticed the ai never really outright states what section 230 really *is*, it somewhat vaguely dances around the main concept that it is a controvercial internet privacy law, but not much else. It nevery specifies any of the policies this law would put in place.
- This law brings into discussion the topic of overprotecting children. While on one hand, there is without a doubt malicious content on the internet that could cause harm to children, completely sealing away anything that fullfills the subjective criteria "offensive" is akin to trying to protect children from the entire world at once.
