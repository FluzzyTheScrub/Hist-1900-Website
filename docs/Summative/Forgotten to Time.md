Time and time again, instances of technology becoming forgotten upon the creation of newer tech occurs. As the new and improved technology outperforms its predecessor, the technology slowly fades from the public consciousness, and is only remembered in passing. Unless a specific technology is particularily crucial to the history of a currently used one, it is often forgotten, or rarely mentioned.

Some examples include:
- The [[Punch Cards]] used by [[Jacard's Loom]] and similar foundational programmable machines. Though this technology was paramount for the creation of modern programmable languages, it is usually regarded as a footnote in the history of tech, and it is very unlikely that modern machines would use one today, making this technology "lost" (although contrary to my initial belief, this technology may in some way still see [[Modern Day Punchcards|some niche modern day usage.]] )

- The [[Gutta-Percha]] plant, once a widely used natural insulator, now primarily forgotten as a building material.

- Charles Babbage's [Difference Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine). Though this machine never saw any practical commercial release, this is an instance of technology lost to time. Although it was capable of such calculations, it was never created until much after it was surpassed by better calculatory machines.

- !!GEOCITIES!!

- !!NETSCAPE!!

- Discussed briefly in the [[The Old Web]] note, Gopher programs are now a primarily forgotten part of internet history that acted as a proto-browser for early internet users.
