One major linkage between all 5 sources I noticed was the fact that all of them in some way cover the topic of storage of data in one way or another:

[[@We May Think]]- Author Vannevar Bush constantly mentions the importance of updating the methods of storing data as technology improves.

[[@From Clay Tablets to Web]]- The entire article covers methods both historical and modern that were used to categorize, and store books and other forms of data.

[[@The Amherst Method]]- The article discusses how one particular data storage method, the Dewy Decimal system, originated from a combination of multiple other data storage methods.

[[@How The Page Matters]]- The article describes that the page is a form of data storage that has changed drastically throughout time to fit various needs.

[[@Origins of the Binary Code]]- The article desribes the history of binary code, a method used to effectively store data such as instructions within a series of ones and zeroes.
