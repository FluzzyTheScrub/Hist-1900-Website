A major linking element I noticed between these 5 articles was they all involve the various impacts the advancement of informational technology:

[[@The Information Paradox]]- Arguably the strongest of the 5, the Information Paradox covers the concept of information theory, or, the breaking up of information into information enriched data that can be translated back into understandable information, AKA the concept of computer code.

[[@Visions of Telephony]]- This article represents the social and political impacts that the invention of the telephone had on society, the increased interconnectivity among people, as well as the corperate battles of the new gargantuan tech companies.

[[@Faxed]]- This article represents the newly established large businesses had on other forms of technology, as newer ideas like the fax machine were largely ignored over the likes of the popular telephone.

[[@A Victorian Ecological Disaster]]- This article represents the environmental effects of the telegraph, as the high demand of new cable networks nearly drove the plant used to manufacture the wires to extinction.

[[@When Computers Were Women]]- This article represents the societal shift that ocurred alongside the recognition of how valuable informational transferrance was, as the typically disregarded work of coding was left to women, but after the realizationf the value of ENIAC machine, the women were shoved and scrubbed from the history of computing in favour of men.
