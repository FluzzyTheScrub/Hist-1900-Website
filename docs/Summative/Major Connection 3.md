[[@Why ARPANET Was Built]]- The origins of the internet were from the ARPA protocol, a project which the US government paid top dollar for a system capable of withstanding nuclear conflict. This represents a period in which the government essentially owned the internet, a fate which is at risk of occurring again as laws begin closing in on the freedoms of the internet.

[[@Wire Pirates]]- This article discusses many of the early cybersecurity issues of the early internet, an issue which has only increased as the internet is interlinked with everyday objects like appliances and entertainment systems. As the internet grows ever closer to the everyday, we must have the security to protect it.

[[@The Geopolitical Economy of the Global Internet Infrastructure]]- This article represents the [[Businessification of The Internet]]. [[The Old Web|Like the internet before]] [[The Dot Com Crash]], the internet is at risk of going from a place of personal expression, to glorified adspace.

[[@Intelligent machines and the growing importance of ethics]]- This article represents the issues of AI becoming in creasing advanced without regards to the consequences.

As tech grows larger, the slow process of [[Enshitification]] begins to set in from the sources listed above and more, which risks errosion of the internet we know today, much like how it did in the 90s.
