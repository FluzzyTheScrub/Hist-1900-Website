For the initial tutorial of the course, I was asked what I wanted to get out of the course, to which I responded:

## More insight on the origins of the internet, and the culture on it.

While the initial section was more the general theme of the entire course, the origins of internet culture was something that was gradually revealed throughout the course.

The question resulted in the following journey:

[[Jacard's Loom]]
[[Punch Cards]]
[[Gutta-Percha]]
[[Seabound Cables]]
[[The Dot Com Crash]]
[[The Death of Geocities]]

Beginning with [[Jacard's Loom]], though not essentially the internet itself, the loom instead had a familial community to it, which could be considered the very first "pre-pre-pre-pre internet culture", considering that the technology of the loom would later go on to result in the creation of the internet. Since the looms were contained within the homes of the workers, it was often a family effort, as each member of the family operated a different aspect of the work: Working the loom itself, winding the material, gathering the product, etc. 

A notable aspect of this loom was that it could be "programmed" to produce a particular pattern by changing the order of which weaving hooks raised and fell. Thus, by punching a particular series of hole in a piece of paper, a loom could be programmed to produce a particular pattern. Thus, [[Punch Cards]] became a staple of the loom, as it took the manual labour out of producing a particular pattern, and the same pattern could be repeated as long as the cards was withheld. The act of programming cards would go on to become modern day programming, an act which some of the earliest internet users bonded over. Since the old internet was only a few steps away from raw software, the only people who *could* use it originally were programmers, who often bonded over their shared interest in computers. Thus, the simple punch card indirectly created some of the earliest internet culture through the creation of programming.

Following use in the of punch cards in Jacard's loom, punch cards went on to be used in telegraphs, in which the cards could be usesd to slowly punch out messages.

The telegrah itself was an incredible tool for communication across large distances, however it had the restriction of being primarily landbound, as at the time no cables were capable of crossing the ocean. That was until the discovery of [[Gutta-Percha]], a tree that produced a rubbery sap capable of being turned into sumbergible telegraph cables known as submarine cables. These submarine cables allowed for the creation of some of the first cross atlantic communication lines, allowing users to communicate with an ocean apart from one another. This concept of long distance communication is also a major factor of internet culture, as it is the erasure of distance between members of the internet that allowed for the online culture to develop in a unique way that none before had.

The concept of underwater cables was again repeated in the internet era of the 90s as described in [[Seabound Cables]] underwater internet cables were constructed with funds amassed by dot com companies in the peak of the dot com bubble. In the early 90s the internet became more mainstream, with self expression was the primary focus of internet culture, as flocks of new users joined with the idea that internet was a place to show yourself to the world. Webhosts like Geocities, Angelfire, and Tripods provided a place for the less tech-savvy to host their personal websites, creating gathering grounds for various communities of the internet. At this point a majority of internet traffic was run the the submarine cables, meaning they were the physical objects tying the community of the internet together.

Come the early 2000s, the once prosperous times ceased with the [[The Dot Com Crash]], in which the value of internet-related companies plummeted, notably ones with "dot com" in the name. During this time, only the wealthiest tech companies survived, meaning that many once popular websites died off, or were purchased by larger companies, meaning many internet communities at this time were scattered. 

As the 2000's progressed, some of the more modern internet networking sites such as Youtube and Facebook appear, marking a general shift from personally designed websites, to profiles on corperation owned platforms. As the platforms shifted, so did the community of the internet, as the general mindset shifted from creating websites to display personal interests, to creating viral content. Most remaining websites of the old net began to truly die off by now, and such a fate faced Geocities, as after being purchased by Yahoo in 1999, the website was shut down by 2009 without warning, and with it, the spirit of the old internet, and the income of the new modern internet community.

I would say that my initial goal was accomplished, and more, as much of what I initially considered the "internet community" at the time of writing the response only encapsulated the 2000's era. Though the "true internet community" came into being roughly around the 90s, this course has demonstrated that comunnities build around specific machinery is not a new concept, as even in the time of Jacard's loom, communities were built within the communities around the looms. The primary difference between now and then was the communicative capabilities increased, allowing individials from further distances to interact, until eventually, the internet community we know today was born.
