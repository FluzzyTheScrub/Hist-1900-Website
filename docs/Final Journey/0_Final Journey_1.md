## What is the most powerful thing you've learned this course?

From this class, the most powerful thing I've learned was that the primary goal of the internet was ultimately to close the spacetime cost of communication; we strove to send things even faster over longer stretches of time, closing this hypothetical gap.

This question resulted with the resulting journey:
[[Tyranny of Distance]]
[[Tax on Nature]]
[[A Fight With an Octopus]]
[[Packet Switching]]
[[ARPANET]]
[[The Old Web]]

The journey begins with the [[Tyranny of Distance]], a discussion of the amazing capabilities of the telegraph in combating the time-space gap. The amazing telegraph machine could sound  messages over massive distances at speeds completely unheard of at the time. This was a game changer for the British Empire, as information could be easily spread across Britain. 

However, could this technology be used to communicate even further? This question was shortly answered with the introduction of the rubber from the sap of a [[Gutta-Percha]] tree, which just so happened to be the perfect material for creating a cable that could be run underwater. By this time in history, the value of telegraphs had skyrocketed, lining the pockets of telecommunication companies, and allowing them to attempt much more expensive endevours, such as running telegraph cables to areas separated by the ocean. Thusly, submarine cables were fabricated using the Gutta-Percha sap, and enabled the space-time distance to be shortened even further as networks were established across vast bodies of water. This new network allowed the British empire to communicate with colonies that were oceans apart in a fraction of the time, which only increased the telegraph fervor. This had a massive impact on the environment however, as discussed in [[Tax on Nature]], the Gutta-Percha trees were incredibly inefficient to grow and harvest, and nearly went extinct due to the sheer demand of submarine cables. Fortunately, the telegraph boom soon settled down, and demand with it. 

Hot on the heels of the telegraph was the telephone, a new machine that allowed users to project their voices across large distances as opposed to just messages, which minorly increased the spacetime difference, as voice messages could carry messages could carry a slight amount of information more than the telegraph. Within the US, the telephone had become a heavily monopolized business, as companies like Bell fought for control for cable space. This is where the note [[A Fight With an Octopus]] comes in, as in an act of anti-competition, phone companies refused to share the same lines as one another, resulting in a mess of cables hanging over the heads of the public.

In the note, a cartoon image an an octopus is displayed, which represents the Bell company's telephone wires, as since the company was the largest, it had the largest network overall, which only expanded daily. This action unintentionally further decreased the overall space-time cost, as in having a much more thoroughly dispersed cable network, the bell company could afford to add wires to much more remote areas of the US, only further increasing the chance that any message could be directly sent to the target, as opposed to a friend nearby having to carry the message. 

While phone lines were incredibly useful, they also had a limit however, as it was incredibly difficult to communicate data without utilizing a constant, uninterrupted stream of it. With the introduction of computers, this style of informational travel was impractical when trying to get two separate computers to communicate, as the data was prone to corrupt minor parts of the data, rendering it entirely useless, and was also computationally expensive. However, both American electrical engineer Paul Baran and UK Computer Scientist Donald Davies came up with a similar idea around the same time: What if you broke up the data before sending it? Thus, the concept of [[Packet Switching]] was born. This method of informational travel allowed larger pieces of data to be sent quicker by breaking it up into multiple segments, and sending each segment to other computers in the computer network, and recombine once the target computer was reached, thus, the time-space difference shortened again as data transfer grew faster.

This method of data transfer was not immediatley well recieved however, as no matter where it was pitched, the idea was generally disregarded. In a phone-centric world, there was no need for packet switching. However, as the Cold War brewed, there was a need for an information sharing network that was resiliant to damage in case of any nuclear attacks. Packet switching just so happened to fit this bill, as since the method has no reliance on a central computer, it can loose multiple nodes and still function. Thus, the ARPA protocal was designed, which eventually became [[ARPANET]], the proto internet.

As ARPANET became more available, more and more users began to use it, resulting in an influx of user, and thus, an influx of new connections. New undersea internet cables were constructed, computers grew faster, then finally, [[The Old Web]] was born, the fastest that data had ever travelled at that point, as data could be sent across the globe near instantly.

This leads to today, where the time-space difference has almost been entirely defeated, we can sent data to one-another near instantly through the internet, which is the result of centuries of innovating even faster methods of sending data across long distances.
