In [[@From Clay Tablets to Web]], author Shiv Kumar mentions that before standard indexing systems,  libraries would often have indexing decided by the library staff themselves. Such systems could pontentially be biased on what the library curaters consider "valuable". However, in the case of  the Dewy Decimal system, this potential bias is also present. Since the Dewy Decimal system is so widespread, this means any potential biasses in the system have also permiated any libraries/storage systems that use it.
