#WhenComputersWereWomen #TheAmherstMethod #leftOutOfHistory #Link 

An interesting link between [[@When Computers Were Women]] and [[@The Amherst Method]] is recognizing in cases where references go missing, it seems to be the result of purposeful neglect, or bending of truth. 

In the case of [[@When Computers Were Women]], the women who worked on the ENIAC were purposefully not mentioned, undermined, or in some cases [[Scrubbed From The Picture|entirely cropped out of photographs]], all in the name of stripping power from the role. Similarily, [[@The Amherst Method]] mentions that the accredited creator of the Dewy Decimal system, Melvil Dewy, seemingly [[Origins of An Idea|under-referenced the works used to create his system]], ultimately claiming the system, as his own.
