Though the concept of laying underwater communication cables may seem a modern concept, it actually outdates the internet by roughly over a century.

Though attempts at building an undersea cable originally failed, by the mid 1860's a growing communication boom saw telegraph companies rapidly growing in value and power, as author D Winseck describes:
>Ultimately, the consolidation of domestic telegraph industries in Britain, Europe, and North America by the mid-1860s yielded enormous corporate entities with pockets deep enough to “wire the world.”
>[[@The Geopolitical Economy of the Global Internet Infrastructure]] Pg, 232

The telegraph frenzy was so intense the [[Gutta-Percha]] tree, a species of tree related to the cable creation process was [[Present Echoes Past|nearly wiped out]] as countless comanies banked on the power of telegraph cables to make them fortunes. However, as Winseck explains

>After this rapid inflation of their market capitalization, the two enterprises represented over 40 percent of the total capital invested in the industry. The (telegraph) bubble was marred by scandal and corruption as well.
>[[@The Geopolitical Economy of the Global Internet Infrastructure]] Pg 234

Resulting in a massive telecommunication crash by 1874, ending the cable fervor, and essentially halting the construction of new submarine cables.

Fast forward to 1997, and an incredibly similar set of events occured.

The introduction of the internet created a massive economic boom, resulting in many internet hosting companies to grow massively in value as businesses tossed money at anything with a "dot com". In response to the demand (and simply because they had the money to) countless submarine cables were constructed. Winseck explains that:

>As of the end of 2016, the global internet’s backbone consisted of 356 international submarine cables with a total length of about 1.3 million kilometers. Currently, 99 percent of all international internet traffic travels through these cables: a single fiber pair in a submarine cable (which typically has a dozen or so fiber pairs) can carry as much traffic as all the geosynchronous satellites orbiting the planet combined.
>[[@The Geopolitical Economy of the Global Internet Infrastructure]] Pg 238

However, this boom would not last, as by 2000-2001, [[The Dot Com Crash]] occurred, crippling many of the companies and businesses that invested in the internet. As a result, the number of cables built nearly ceased, as demonstrated by the graph below:

As demonstrated in the graph, before the crash, the amount spent on cables was fairly high, representing more frequent cable construction, while afterwards, the cost dips significantly.

It is interesting to recognize that roughly the same event happened 100 years apart: A communication boom resulted in mass expansion of the existing infrastructure, only for the boom to crash, and the number of cables built essentially ceasing.
