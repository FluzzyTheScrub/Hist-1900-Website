With the [[Changing Times|lawless state of the internet]] it was only so long before some laws were put in place to attempt to control the chaos. In the early day of the internet, moderating websites was a difficult proposition, as the sheer volume of users and posts made it inevitable that some nasty content would slip through, resulting in the hosters facing reprocussions. Thus hosters generally left the content alone, not wanting to deal with the consequence of missing anything, allowing websites to fester. In order to circumvent this, section 230 was proposed:

In essence, this law protects website hosters from the behavior of users of their sites, by ensuring any material found on their website did not necessarily represent the hoster's own beliefs, regardless of if the host attempted to maderate or not; This is what allows sites such as 4Chan and 8Chan to exist today. This law additionally has clauses for the cases of truly malicious users, negating this freedom from hosters who had truly malicious intent, or knowingly harboured specific illegal material.
