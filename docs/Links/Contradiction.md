While Vannevar Bush in [[@We May Think]] implies that some shortened verbal language would fit best for future storage of information, author Shiv Kumar of [[@From Clay Tablets to Web]] implies that the way information is categorized and searched for may be more important. A faster searching method not only makes information easier to use, but does not require learning the "scientific jargon" that Bush's proposed storage language would require. While verbal coding could be usefull, the general heavy amount of dedication required to use it would likely outweigh the benefits, and a categorized search algorithm such as a language translation program would be likely be more efficient.
