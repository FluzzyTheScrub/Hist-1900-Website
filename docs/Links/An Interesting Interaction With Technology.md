An interesting note on the situation of [[The Earliest Hackers| phreaks hijacking phone lines]] is that it represents a farly unique human-machine interaction: Manipulating computers through audio. Wheras most hacking we think of today involves manipulating the files via terminal, or moving through file directoires, using tones to manipulate phone lines essentially represents a person translating their demands directly to machine language.

In programming, machine language is essentially data in its rawest form; pure [[Bits and Bytes|binary code]] instructions that machines entirely understand, but is near impossible for humans to read. In order for our demands to be understood by computers, we require an assembly language, such as Java, Python, or C to take our instructions, and translate them to machine language. 

However, in the instance of the phone tone whistles, the phreaks essentially taught themselves a form of machine language, and in a way, spoke somthing similar to the [[Our Present Languages Are Not Especially Adapted|hypothetical verbal coding language]] proposed by Vanaver Bush in [[@We May Think]].
