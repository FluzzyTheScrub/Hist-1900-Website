One noteworthy event in the history of the telegraph was the [1859 Carrington Event](https://www.history.com/news/a-perfect-solar-superstorm-the-1859-carrington-event), during which a powerful solar storm fried many telegraph machines. This event may have potentially caused some to consider using a telephone over a telegraph, as there would be no way to truly tell what had happened, other than primarily telegraphs being effected.

As an additional note, an interesting thought is what would happen in the modern world should a similar event occur, considering we are much more technologically reliant than at the time the event ocurred.
