Within [[@We May Think]], author Vannevar Bush remarks upon a scenario in which he envisions [[A Whole Roomful of Girls Armed With Simple Key Board Punches]], which I discussed demonstrated some instances of dismissing female workers.

With some additional context from J.S Light's article, [[@When Computers Were Women]], programming was typically viewed as a "woman's job" as it was viewed as less important, stating:

>Due in large measure to the feeling among engineers that their college and industrial experience is being wasted and thwarted by mere repetitive calculation.
>[[@When Computers Were Women]], Pg 460

This evidence further solidifies that Bush's example poorly represents female workers, as during the time the article was written, Bush imagined only women would be working in the time wasting position of computation and coding.
