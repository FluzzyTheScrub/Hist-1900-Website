In, [[@Origins of the Binary Code]], author F.G Heath references [[Punch Cards]], a technology used to program machines by punching holes into a paper card which would cause internal arms to move or not move based on the inputted pattern. 

The book [[@How The Page Matters]] details how pages can be defined not only a physical space on which to write on like how [[Today the page is most familiar]], but also a space where information is stored. 

This is best represented by punch cards, a piece of paper which literally is imbued with information on how a farbric will be woven within itself. A better representation would a modern "punch card" like a scantron sheet, in which carefully patterned pencil marks are interpreted by a machine to represent an entire exam's worth of responses.
