Another interesting thought on the telephone wars; where were the women in this story? The main mention of women were involved in the discussion of Alexander Grahm Bell's resoning for working on the telephone:
>Alexander Graham Bell’s original goal was not to transmit speech, but to make it visible. Bell was keenly interested in deafness— his mother, Eliza, and future wife, Mabel, were both deaf
>[[@Visions of Telephony]] Pg 61

However beyond this, there is barely any mention of women on the corperate/technology side of the story.
