Described within [[@The Information Paradox]] is the concept of Moore's Law, or, the dicovery that:

>Circuit designers were able to compress the size of transistors, putting about twice as many into the same physical space at no additional cost every 18 months.
>[[@The Information Paradox]] Pg 471

Essentially, it was noticed that the power of computation roughly doubled every two years, meaning only half as much space was required to have the same amount of processing power previously reached.

This is notable for a few reasons:

- Moore's law is a key factor in how computers went from room filling machines, such as in  the case of the [[@When Computers Were Women|ENIAC]], to the small laptops we have today.

- It rendered Vannaver Bush's predition on the [[Encylopedia Britannica]] completely plausible, as within time, the computational power, and size of computers would increase enough to match his prediction.
