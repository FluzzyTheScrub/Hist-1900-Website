With a network tool as powerful as the internet, it is unsurprising that it sees use by the military. In their article [[@The Geopolitical Economy of the Global Internet Infrastructure]], author D, Winseck explains:

>Governments and militaries also account for a significant portion of internet traffic. Indeed, 90 to 95 percent of US government traffic, including sensitive diplomatic and military orders, travels over privately owned cables to reach officials in the field.

This somewhat resembles the internet reaching [[ARPANET|back to its roots]], while also representing that the internet originaly was, and still continues to be a result of [[Warfare And Technology]].
