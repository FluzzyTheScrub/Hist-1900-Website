Continuing from a previous note [[Contradiction]], the article [[@The Information Paradox]] additonally contradicts a point made within [[@We May Think]]. 

Vannevar's concept of [[Our Present Languages Are Not Especially Adapted|some kind of verbal code]], is   further proven to be ineffective due to the importance of repetition in information theory. Within information theory, the number of repetitions used to encode information [[Bits and Bytes|directly correlates to the clarity of the message]], meaning that within Vannevar's hyopthetical language, messages would have to be incredibly long, and repetetive in order to hold any information of value, which could easily be missinterpereted, or forgotten. Considering a representing [a *single* letter in binary rquires memorizing an exact 8 character long sequence](http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html) communicating in such a way would not be worth the headache of attempting.

As an additonal humerous note, the "father" of information theory, Claude Shannon, happened to be a student of author Vannaver Bush, meaning his student's own theory disproved his concept.
