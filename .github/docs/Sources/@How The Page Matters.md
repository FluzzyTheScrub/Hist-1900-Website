Reference:
Mak, [“Architectures of the Page”](https://raley.english.ucsb.edu/wp-content2/uploads/234/Mak.pdf) , chapter 1 of _How the Page Matters._

Summary:
*How the Page Matters* broadly covers the evolution of not only the structure of pages, but the general evolution of how we stored the written (and typed) word. The introduction describes that the definition of a page has greatly changed with time, and methods of writing/reading.

Key Take Aways:
The introduction and first chapter explain that a page is much more than the single piece of paper we associate the word with, but the result of countless centuries of research, discovery, and experimentation. Today's page not only is made of different materials, but also has a vastly different structure than pages of the past.
