ABSTRACT:
>Although a debate about the origins of the Dewey Decimal Classification Scheme has been going on for generations, historical consensus remains elusive. This paper contributes new information to the historiography on the origins of the scheme: (1) by grounding an account of Melvil Dewey's thinking as he was crafting the Decimal Classification on an analysis of a larger body of sources than previous classification historians have con sulted; and (2) by expanding and deepening historical understanding of the contextual forces influencing his decisions on the classification structure.

Summary:
This article covers the general history of the Dewy Decimal system of sorting books, including its original publishing, as well as the variety of influences that Melvil Dewy was influenced by whilst creating the system.


Key take aways:
From this article, the main take away I noticed was just how little credit is given to those who had a hand in creating the Dewy Decimal system, but are generally forgotten in place of the "creator" and namesake of the system, Melvil Dewy. I found that frequently, the Author Wayne Wiegand would go on stretches of periods explaining how little Dewy referenced his sources, and that a majority of his references were often shaky at best. Large sums of the sections were often dedicated to the efforts put into finding the genuine sources of some of Dewy's concepts, rather than passages with simple explaination of the contributer's work.

On one hand, this shows how frequently history builds upon itself, on the other, it shows how frequently contributors to history are forgotten.
