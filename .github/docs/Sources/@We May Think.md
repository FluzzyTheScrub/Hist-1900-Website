ABSTRACT:
>_As Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, Dr. Vannevar Bush has coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. In this significant article he holds up an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased. He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. For years inventions have extended man's physical powers rather than the powers of his mind. Trip hammers that multiply the fists, microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern science. Now, says Dr. Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages. The perfection of these pacific instruments should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from their war work. Like Emerson's famous address of 1837 on "The American Scholar," this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge. — THE EDITOR_

Summary:
This article follows the author Vannevar Bush and his thought process that as we create new technology increases other aspects of our lives, we must also enhance existing systems around said technology to make the most of it. He provides multiple examples of the shortcomings some of the technologies from both past and hypothetical future, and how they could be enhanced if the proper adjustments were made to systems used by said technology.

Key take aways:
One of Bush's primary areas of focus seems to be on updating the number of ways information is recorded and stored, as he seems to imply that as discoveries are made, the need for efficient storage methods grows immensely, to ensure these discoveries are properly documented.
