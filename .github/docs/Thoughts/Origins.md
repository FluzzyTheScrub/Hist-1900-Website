>Despite its wide circulation, however, the article fails to clarify the classification's origins. Dewey did acknowledge a debt to Sir Francis Bacon (who nearly three centuries earlier had hypothesized that all knowledge derived from memory, reason, and imagination, and that these three invariably produced works of history, philosophy, and *belles lettre*), but he failed to locate his scheme in the continuum of library classification history and thus generally ignored the contributions and influences of his predecessors.

In this quote, Wiegand brings up a fairly common occurrance in history: The actual creator of something being overshadowed by whoever brought it to the public eye first, and becoming its "inventor". In this case, the storage system is accredited to Melvil Dewy, the method even being named after him, while the contribution of Sir Francis Bacon, and potentially others are less remembered making them "left out of history" of the system.

This concept is also somewhat [[Biased Sorting|applicable to a scenario mentioned in]] [[@From Clay Tablets to Web]]
