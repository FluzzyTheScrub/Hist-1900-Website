Bush seems to rarely discuss the position of women throughout this article, primarily referring to hypothetical people as "he", "him", and "man". One of Bush's few mentions of women is when he envisions them in simple manual labour tasks, seemingly only mentioning male pronouns when referring to people in positions of skilled labour, or higher positions.

This is quite present in Bush's closing remarks:

>The applications of science have built **man** a well-supplied house, and are teaching **him** to live healthily therein. They have enabled **him** to throw masses of people against one another with cruel weapons. They may yet allow **him** truly to encompass the great record and to grow in the wisdom of race experience. **He** may perish in conflict before **he** learns to wield that record for **his** true good. Yet, in the application of science to the needs and desires of **man**, it would seem to be a singularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose hope as to the outcome.
