The CDA was passed into law on February 15th, 2006 and Section 230 became effective that same year. This provision of the Act has been highly controversial due in part to its vagueness; it is not clear what exactly constitutes \u201cobscene\u201d or \u201csexually explicit material.\u201d</p> <p>The Supreme Court ruled on a case involving this section of the CDA, Ashcroft v. ACLU, that Section 230 was constitutional and did not violate First Amendment rights as it only restricted access to certain materials deemed obscene by Congress or state legislatures; it didn\u2019t ban any particular type of speech outright.</p> <p>The CDA has been amended several times since its inception, most recently with the passage of The Protect Act (PROTECT) which further clarified what material is considered \u201cobscene\u201d and made sure that Section 230 was not being abused to access such materials by minors. This law also provided penalties for those who would try to circumvent these restrictions, making it clear that the government takes this provision of the CDA very seriously.</p> <p>Section 230 has been a highly contested part of the Communications Decency Act since its inception and remains so today as people continue to debate what material is considered \u201cobscene\u201d or if minors should have access to such materials at all, let alone via circumvention tools like virtual private networks.</p> <p>Many fellow classmates had some interesting points on the matter on Hypothes.is</p> <p> https://hyp.is/UBP65NF0Ee2YT2s6owwSCg/shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/assets/slides/mar27 As Eric pointed out, this is indeed the case, in order to completely shield youth from harmful material, it would require extreme privacy invasion to completely confirm a person was of legal age. Such things would go against the few freedoms of the current internet.</p> <p> https://hyp.is/DCbz4szMEe2chhPJkg16VA/shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/assets/slides/mar27 This anonymous student brings up another good point, as what is deemed \"offensive\" may vary from person to person, especially in the view of governmental figures, of whom the most powerful tend to be older, with a stronger belief in older (and often less progressive) values.

Whereas human writes must carefully back up their claims and proofs, an ai is merely mimmicking a professionally written article, and has no incentive to properly source any of its claims, and thus, will pull from anything and everything that fits the general structure of the desired claim. This goes back to the concept of The Chinese Room.</p> <p>For my own notes on the article: - I noticed the ai never really outright states what section 230 really is, it somewhat vaguely dances around the main concept that it is a controvercial internet privacy law, but not much else. It nevery specifies any of the policies this law would put in place. - This law brings into discussion the topic of overprotecting children. While on one hand, there is without a doubt malicious content on the internet that could cause harm to children, completely sealing away anything that fullfills the subjective criteria \"offensive\" is akin to trying to protect children from the entire world at once.</p> <p>2023-04-05</p>"},{"location":"Discussions/Class%20Discussions%20on%20Communications%20in%20the%20Civil%20War/","title":"LinkOut","text":"<p>URL: https://www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com/communications-in-the-civil-war.html</p> <p>Seeing as many of the technologies used during the American Civil War were discussed throughout the class, as well as the continuous theme of Warfare And Technology, this source was an interesting point of discussion.</p> <p> https://hyp.is/nWByFL9yEe27kFtBGEg1VQ/www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com/communications-in-the-civil-war.html</p> <p>The ciphers mentioned in this note very likely evolved into programming code as time progressed.

The amazing telegraph machine could sound  messages over massive distances at speeds completely unheard of at the time. This was a game changer for the British Empire, as information could be easily spread across Britain. </p> <p>However, could this technology be used to communicate even further? This question was shortly answered with the introduction of the rubber from the sap of a Gutta-Percha tree, which just so happened to be the perfect material for creating a cable that could be run underwater. By this time in history, the value of telegraphs had skyrocketed, lining the pockets of telecommunication companies, and allowing them to attempt much more expensive endevours, such as running telegraph cables to areas separated by the ocean. Thusly, submarine cables were fabricated using the Gutta-Percha sap, and enabled the space-time distance to be shortened even further as networks were established across vast bodies of water. This new network allowed the British empire to communicate with colonies that were oceans apart in a fraction of the time, which only increased the telegraph fervor. This had a massive impact on the environment however, as discussed in Tax on Nature, the Gutta-Percha trees were incredibly inefficient to grow and harvest, and nearly went extinct due to the sheer demand of submarine cables. Fortunately, the telegraph boom soon settled down, and demand with it. </p> <p>Hot on the heels of the telegraph was the telephone, a new machine that allowed users to project their voices across large distances as opposed to just messages, which minorly increased the spacetime difference, as voice messages could carry messages could carry a slight amount of information more than the telegraph. Within the US, the telephone had become a heavily monopolized business, as companies like Bell fought for control for cable space. This is where the note A Fight With an Octopus comes in, as in an act of anti-competition, phone companies refused to share the same lines as one another, resulting in a mess of cables hanging over the heads of the public.   In the note, a cartoon image an an octopus is displayed, which represents the Bell company's telephone wires, as since the company was the largest, it had the largest network overall, which only expanded daily. This action unintentionally further decreased the overall space-time cost, as in having a much more thoroughly dispersed cable network, the bell company could afford to add wires to much more remote areas of the US, only further increasing the chance that any message could be directly sent to the target, as opposed to a friend nearby having to carry the message. </p> <p>While phone lines were incredibly useful, they also had a limit however, as it was incredibly difficult to communicate data without utilizing a constant, uninterrupted stream of it. With the introduction of computers, this style of informational travel was impractical when trying to get two separate computers to communicate, as the data was prone to corrupt minor parts of the data, rendering it entirely useless, and was also computationally expensive. However, both American electrical engineer Paul Baran and UK Computer Scientist Donald Davies came up with a similar idea around the same time: What if you broke up the data before sending it? Thus, the concept of Packet Switching was born. This method of informational travel allowed larger pieces of data to be sent quicker by breaking it up into multiple segments, and sending each segment to other computers in the computer network, and recombine once the target computer was reached, thus, the time-space difference shortened again as data transfer grew faster.</p> <p>This method of data transfer was not immediatley well recieved however, as no matter where it was pitched, the idea was generally disregarded. In a phone-centric world, there was no need for packet switching. However, as the Cold War brewed, there was a need for an information sharing network that was resiliant to damage in case of any nuclear attacks. Packet switching just so happened to fit this bill, as since the method has no reliance on a central computer, it can loose multiple nodes and still function. Thus, the ARPA protocal was designed, which eventually became ARPANET, the proto internet.</p> <p>As ARPANET became more available, more and more users began to use it, resulting in an influx of user, and thus, an influx of new connections. New undersea internet cables were constructed, computers grew faster, then finally, The Old Web was born, the fastest that data had ever travelled at that point, as data could be sent across the globe near instantly.</p> <p>This leads to today, where the time-space difference has almost been entirely defeated, we can sent data to one-another near instantly through the internet, which is the result of centuries of innovating even faster methods of sending data across long distances.</p> <p>2023-04-05</p>"},{"location":"Final%20Journey/0_Final%20Journey_2/","title":"0 Final Journey 2","text":"<p>For the initial tutorial of the course, I was asked what I wanted to get out of the course, to which I responded:</p>"},{"location":"Final%20Journey/0_Final%20Journey_2/#more-insight-on-the-origins-of-the-internet-and-the-culture-on-it","title":"More insight on the origins of the internet, and the culture on it.","text":"<p>While the initial section was more the general theme of the entire course, the origins of internet culture was something that was gradually revealed throughout the course.</p> <p>The question resulted in the following journey:</p> <p>Jacard's Loom Punch Cards Gutta-Percha Seabound Cables The Dot Com Crash The Death of Geocities</p> <p>Beginning with Jacard's Loom, though not essentially the internet itself, the loom instead had a familial community to it, which could be considered the very first \"pre-pre-pre-pre internet culture\", considering that the technology of the loom would later go on to result in the creation of the internet. Since the looms were contained within the homes of the workers, it was often a family effort, as each member of the family operated a different aspect of the work: Working the loom itself, winding the material, gathering the product, etc. </p> <p>A notable aspect of this loom was that it could be \"programmed\" to produce a particular pattern by changing the order of which weaving hooks raised and fell. Thus, by punching a particular series of hole in a piece of paper, a loom could be programmed to produce a particular pattern. Thus, Punch Cards became a staple of the loom, as it took the manual labour out of producing a particular pattern, and the same pattern could be repeated as long as the cards was withheld. The act of programming cards would go on to become modern day programming, an act which some of the earliest internet users bonded over. Since the old internet was only a few steps away from raw software, the only people who could use it originally were programmers, who often bonded over their shared interest in computers. Thus, the simple punch card indirectly created some of the earliest internet culture through the creation of programming.</p> <p>Following use in the of punch cards in Jacard's loom, punch cards went on to be used in telegraphs, in which the cards could be usesd to slowly punch out messages.  Source: https://historictech.com/when-punch-cards-ruled-computers/</p> <p>The telegrah itself was an incredible tool for communication across large distances, however it had the restriction of being primarily landbound, as at the time no cables were capable of crossing the ocean. That was until the discovery of Gutta-Percha, a tree that produced a rubbery sap capable of being turned into sumbergible telegraph cables known as submarine cables. These submarine cables allowed for the creation of some of the first cross atlantic communication lines, allowing users to communicate with an ocean apart from one another. This concept of long distance communication is also a major factor of internet culture, as it is the erasure of distance between members of the internet that allowed for the online culture to develop in a unique way that none before had.</p> <p>The concept of underwater cables was again repeated in the internet era of the 90s as described in Seabound Cables underwater internet cables were constructed with funds amassed by dot com companies in the peak of the dot com bubble. In the early 90s the internet became more mainstream, with self expression was the primary focus of internet culture, as flocks of new users joined with the idea that internet was a place to show yourself to the world. Webhosts like Geocities, Angelfire, and Tripods provided a place for the less tech-savvy to host their personal websites, creating gathering grounds for various communities of the internet. At this point a majority of internet traffic was run the the submarine cables, meaning they were the physical objects tying the community of the internet together.</p> <p>Come the early 2000s, the once prosperous times ceased with the The Dot Com Crash, in which the value of internet-related companies plummeted, notably ones with \"dot com\" in the name. During this time, only the wealthiest tech companies survived, meaning that many once popular websites died off, or were purchased by larger companies, meaning many internet communities at this time were scattered. </p> <p>As the 2000's progressed, some of the more modern internet networking sites such as Youtube and Facebook appear, marking a general shift from personally designed websites, to profiles on corperation owned platforms. As the platforms shifted, so did the community of the internet, as the general mindset shifted from creating websites to display personal interests, to creating viral content. Most remaining websites of the old net began to truly die off by now, and such a fate faced Geocities, as after being purchased by Yahoo in 1999, the website was shut down by 2009 without warning, and with it, the spirit of the old internet, and the income of the new modern internet community.</p> <p>I would say that my initial goal was accomplished, and more, as much of what I initially considered the \"internet community\" at the time of writing the response only encapsulated the 2000's era. Though the \"true internet community\" came into being roughly around the 90s, this course has demonstrated that comunnities build around specific machinery is not a new concept, as even in the time of Jacard's loom, communities were built within the communities around the looms. The primary difference between now and then was the communicative capabilities increased, allowing individials from further distances to interact, until eventually, the internet community we know today was born.</p> <p>2023-04-05</p>"},{"location":"Links/An%20Interesting%20Interaction%20With%20Technology/","title":"WirePirates #CyberSecurity #Thought #Link #WeMayThink","text":"<p>An interesting note on the situation of [ phreaks hijacking phone lines]] is that it represents a farly unique human-machine interaction: Manipulating computers through audio.

By 1907, some 200,000 nautical miles of cable criss-crossed the ocean floors. Insulation of the cables from seawater relied on gutta-percha, a natural plastic related to rubber. Gutta-percha is all but forgotten today, but during the Victorian era it was a household word. Ironically, the high-tech Victorian telegraph industry was served by a primitive cottage industry. The gum was extracted by killing wild trees in the forests of Southeast Asia, and the scale of demand ensured that many millions of trees were destroyed. This industry brought about a Victorian ecological disaster that presaged the greater destruction of tropical rain forests occurring today.</p> <p>Summary: The article A Victorian Ecological Disaster: Imperialism, the Telepgraph, and Gutta-Percha covers the interlinked history between the three aforementioned topics, and how they together resulted in massive ecological and humanitarian disasters. Through the discovery of Gutta-Percha plant's conductive properties, it was quickly used on underwater telagraph wires by the British Empire, which allowed information to be sent incredibly quickly. As maintaining the Empire required countless wires to maintain the massive web of telegraph communication, overreliance on gutta-percha began to impact environment as the plant was over-harvested, which further impacted the workers in communities reliant on gutta-percha manufacturing, as they become over-worked, or run out of work as the plant disappeared.</p> <p>Key Take Aways: This article represents many major issues that come alongside the advancement of technology; Over-use of natural resources as demand increases, the role technology plays in conflict/warfare, and the effect technology has on the less fortunate communites.

This article, however, argues that while these internet giants dominate some of the most popular internet services, the ownership and control of core elements of the internet infrastructure\u2014submarine cables, internet exchange points, autonomous system numbers, datacenters, and so on\u2014are tilting increasingly toward the EU and BRICS (i.e., Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) countries and the rest of the world, complicating views of hegemonic US control of the internet and what Susan Strange calls the knowledge structure.</p> <p>Summary: Author D Winseck in this article argues that although  the internet is primarily ruled by the tech giants we hear of daily, in reality, the owners of the internet's hardware and infrastructure that have the most impact on the internet, as the infrastructure is the backbone of the internet.</p> <p>Key Take Aways: The main take away I found from this article was that although we think of the internet as a fairly neutral space, often times many factors that influence it subtly, meaning even something as minor as the ownership of underwater internet cables can result in the difference between a working, and unfunctioning internet.</p> <p>Why It Was Chosen: I found it very interesting to consider the fact that the internet is often influenced by many factors beyond those visible on the surface, so this article was an excellent source of demonstrating this.</p> <p>Related: Cable Conflict, Military Traffic, Seabound Cables, The Dot Com Crash</p> <p>2023-04-03</p>"},{"location":"Sources/%40The%20Information%20Paradox/","title":"TheInformationParadox #Codes #DataStorage #DataTransfer","text":"<p>Reference: Denning, P.

Web. </p> <p>Summary: Chapter two of Visions of Telephony describes the bloody coperate battles fought between the first telephone companies such as Bell, Western Union, and AT&amp;T. The corperate giants each tried their hands at controlling markets; Attempting to sway major businesses such as post offices into trusting their particular brand, or appealing to the population to become \"the people's phone\", all in hopes of coming on top.

Although technology businesses already existed to a degree, the early phone companies represented a shift in business tactics; the telephone required an interconnected network in order to maximize it's potential, resulting in the companies scrambling to spread as far as possible, to both maximize reach, and suffocate other companies.

In this significant article he holds up an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased. He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. For years inventions have extended man's physical powers rather than the powers of his mind. Trip hammers that multiply the fists, microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern science. Now, says Dr. Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages. The perfection of these pacific instruments should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from their war work. Like Emerson's famous address of 1837 on \"The American Scholar,\" this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge. \u2014 THE EDITOR</p> <p>Summary: This article follows the author Vannevar Bush and his thought process that as we create new technology increases other aspects of our lives, we must also enhance existing systems around said technology to make the most of it. He provides multiple examples of the shortcomings some of the technologies from both past and hypothetical future, and how they could be enhanced if the proper adjustments were made to systems used by said technology.</p> <p>Key take aways: One of Bush's primary areas of focus seems to be on updating the number of ways information is recorded and stored, as he seems to imply that as discoveries are made, the need for efficient storage methods grows immensely, to ensure these discoveries are properly documented.</p> <p>Why it was chosen: Vannaver Bush's perspective on the potential future of technology struck a particular chord with me, as seeing just how many of his predictions seemingly came true (in some way or another) is absolutely fascinating to me. </p> <p>Related: A Whole Roomful of Girls Armed With Simple Key Board Punches, Contradiction, Encylopedia Britannica, Ideas on We May Think, Major Connection, Our Present Languages Are Not Especially Adapted, Programming as a Woman's Job, A Glimpse Forwards</p> <p>2023-02</p>"},{"location":"Sources/%40When%20Computers%20Were%20Women/","title":"WhenComputersWereWomen #Gender","text":"<p>Reference: Light, J.

[@Wire Pirates pg 92</p> <p>Some of the earliest instances of cyber security issues began with the telephone in the 60's, with the war between AT&amp;T, and phone \"hackers\" known as phone freaks, or \"phreaks\". During this time, some individuals realized they could manipulate phones to initiate free calls by whistling or using other devices to produce various tones into the reciever. These tones would mimmic the genuine mechanical tones used to operate the phone lines, meaning these phreaks had total control over the phone lines, costing AT&amp;T thousands in lost revenue, [Yet, this only marked the beginning of cyber security.]]</p> <p>More on the history of the phone can be found in [@Visions of Telephony.</p> <p>2023-03-31</p>"},{"location":"Thoughts/The%20Ethical%20Issues%20of%20Neural%20Networks/","title":"IntelligentMachines #ai #Thought","text":"<p>With the increase in the use of neural network AI in our modern time, it is worth discussing some of the ethical issues attached to the use and training of such machines:</p> <p>Creator Vs Ai:</p> <p>A very hot topic in the world of ai ethics right now the the discussion of neural networks and copyright. Neural networks must be fed human created data in order to learn to create material like a human, however there is only so much original content the programmers can create to feed the ai, and eventually they must take to work from other people for more data. This is where the issue with copyright appears, as in a way, the ai is building new data by directly stealing from the author's creation, and without credit, since often times it steals from multiple authors per generated item. In the case of ai writing, this could be stealing direct paragraphs, snippets of text, or other content stolen without producing a source (which also has its own slew of problems). The more controvertial topic is ai art, as ai may end up stealing from multiple artists, copying sections of their works and claiming it as their own. Many ai hosts avoid this controversy by blaming the ai itself, since they technically had no hand in the copyright infringement directly. </p> <p>Privacy Vs Ai:</p> <p>Especially in the case of public ai, there is a distinct possiblity that the privacy of users is at risk when interacting with these machines. Since popular ai chatbots like ChatGpt build themselves from user interaction, there is a distinct possibility that any private information shared with the machine will become forever ingrained within the network, and thus, no longer private to the user alone. This too extends to other neural networks, as sources fed to them may also contain private information, that again when added to the network, is forever part of it. This is even disregarding ai that gathers uses user data like cookies in order to perfectly generate ads, and learn more about the person's demographic for futer advertisement.</p> <p>Truth Vs Ai:</p> <p>An increasingly common issue with ai is that it people tend to blindly trust the \"superintelligent machine\" while in reality, a majority of what the machine creates is complete fabrication. Since most ai are stochastic parrots, what appears to be true intelligence is often a much simpler response to a series of key words, which the attempts to mimmick how a human response would be structured. This means ai is prone to pulling from any source in it's database, even those from untrustworthy or radical sources, or even outright fabricating facts based on unrelated sections from elsewhere in the database, leading to many untrue and fake responses.</p> <p>2023-04-05</p>"},{"location":"Thoughts/The%20First%20Major%20Cataloguing%20Code/","title":"FromClayTabletstoWeb #Codes #atomic","text":"<p>@From Clay Tablets to Web</p> <p>One of IT\u2019s greatest accomplishments is transformation of the card catalogue to the OPAC to facilitate libraries.

As a result, website content often greatly varied; one website could be entirely deticated to shoes, while another could be a professional book review , a complete grab-bag. As a result of the internet's claim as a \"free space to express yourself\", many personal websites had gaudy appearances, eye-burning colour schemes, and were flooded to the brim with images, all in the display of personal expression. A quote from artist Olia Lialina in [[@404 Page Not Found]] best describes the old web as:</p> <p>A web of sudden connections and personal links. Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connection and a more powerful computer. One could say it was the web of the indigenous . . . or the barbarians. In any case, it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com ambitions, professional authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts. [[@404 Page Not Found]] pg 125</p> <p>Webhosts: Some popular web hosts of the time included Geocities, Angelfire, and Tripods, all sites under which users could post their personal websites. These sites offered a place for the less techy to have a space to upload their personal websites. Many of these websites no longer remain today.</p> <p>Early Web Browsers: Before the browsers of today, webistes needed to be reached via directly connecting to their ip, essentially setting the source for [[Packet Switching]]. As expected, this was a huge hurdle, and opened space for an easier way to find websites. In comes Gopher protocols, pages which were essentially massive catalogues of popular links to websites. ![Pasted image 20230405151122.png https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol) This protocol was even further expanded on when they were utilised by some of the first web browsers such as Netscape, which were essentially nicer-looking gopher protocols.
